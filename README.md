Git is a powerful version control system that is useful for saving your work locally and on the web in github. It is also great for working with groups since you can save your work alone if you're not ready to share it with the team and you can see what everyone else is working on and get their work from the server on to your local computer. It is complicated to learn but once you get it, it is an extremely helpful tool.
